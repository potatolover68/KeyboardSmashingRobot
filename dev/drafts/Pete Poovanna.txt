== Career ==
=== Research and engineering ===
Poovanna's academic research is in the field of thermal systems and two-phase heat transfer, focusing on improving the performance of evaporators. His doctoral research centered on the Capillary-Assisted Low-pressure Evaporator (CALPE, a design aimed at improving the heat transfer rate in adsorption chillers that use water as a refrigerant.<ref name="SFU Thesis">{{cite thesis |title=Development of capillary-assisted low pressure evaporator for adsorption chillers |author=Cheppudira Thimmaiah, Poovanna |date=2018 |publisher=Simon Fraser University |url=https://summit.sfu.ca/item/19075 |type=Ph.D. Thesis}}</ref> This work addresses the limited performance of conventional evaporators in adsorption cooling systems, which are typically driven by low-grade waste heat.

His published work includes studies on porous-coated evaporators and adsorption chillers in journals such as ''Scientific Reports'' and ''Energy''.<ref>Cheppudira Thimmaiah, Poovanna et al. "A new approach to compute the porosity and surface roughness of porous coated capillary-assisted low-pressure evaporators."

"Evaluation of low-pressure flooded evaporator performance for adsorption chillers." ''Energy'' (2017). https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544217307913</ref> He is also listed as a co-inventor on a patent application for the Micro Capillary-assisted Low-pressure Evaporator (µCALPE, an advanced design incorporating microchannels and porous coatings to enhance heat transfer, filed through Simon Fraser University.<ref>World Intellectual Property Organization. "Micro Capillary-assisted Low-pressure Evaporator." Patent application WO2019144242A1. https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2019144242</ref>

=== Clean transportation and policy ===
Poovanna writes on climate action, electric mobility, and decarbonisation, including commentary on Canada’s electric-vehicle transition for ''Policy Options''.<ref>Policy Options. "Electric vehicles as part of Canada's climate change solution." 9 July 2018. https://policyoptions.irpp.org/2018/07/electric-vehicles-as-part-of-canadas-climate-change-solution/</ref> His research has been cited in international and provincial policy documents, including a United Nations ESCWA report on transportation electrification<ref>UN ESCWA. "Land Electric Mobility in the Arab Region: Options and Opportunities." 2022. https://www.unescwa.org/sites/default/files/pubs/pdf/land-electric-mobility-arab-region-options-opportunities-english_3.pdf</ref> and a 2018 climate report presented to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.<ref>Environmental Commissioner of Ontario.
