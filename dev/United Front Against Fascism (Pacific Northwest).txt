{{AFC comment|1=Thank you for your efforts on this article so far. There are a number of problems with this article, so some more work is needed. To focus on the top three (there are other issues):
A) There are particular requirements for notability which then reflects on sources. This is set out in [[WP:GNG]] as a general point, and then more specifically [[WP:NORG]] and overlapping that [[WP:CLUB]]. This will need closer sourcing than a generalised archive catalogue, which is in any case primary, not secondary. The other sources look like specific news stories giving specific details. Ideally this would want three profiles of the subject by newspapers, books, radio programmes, giving the whole story, and thus independent secondary sourcing.
B) The article comes across as an essay from someone sympathetic to the organisation's objectives, it's almost promotional in tone. As an encyclopedia the article needs to be totally neutral, and reflect a wider perspective, including any criticism of the organisation.
C) As an essay, it also needs to be converted into encyclopedia's norms - so dates, chronology, where, when, what, how... There can be an assessment section, but this needs to be in proportion to the rest of the content, and backed by reliable sources. Anything that someone may consider to be contentious / open to challenge requires particularly robust sourcing.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The United Front Against Fascism (UFAF) was a coalition formed in the [[Pacific Northwest]] in December 1988 in response to rising neo-Nazi and white supremacist activities. The catalyst for UFAF's creation was the murder of [[Murder of Mulugeta Seraw|Mulugeta Seraw]], an Ethiopian immigrant, by neo-Nazi skinheads in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Shortly after this incident, white supremacist groups, including the Aryan Nations and White Aryan Resistance, announced plans to hold a memorial on [[Whidbey Island]], Washington, for Robert Mathews, a prominent white supremacist killed in a 1984 FBI shootout. In response, [[Radical Women]] and the [[Freedom Socialist Party]] organized a counter-demonstration, which led to the establishment of UFAF.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=United Front Against Fascism records - Archives West |url=https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv743673 |access-date=2025-09-29 |website=archiveswest.orbiscascade.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Eng |first=Lily |date=6 December 1992 |title='I'M DOING WHAT MY SON WOULD HAVE DONE' - IN SON'S STEAD, FATHER'S VOICE FIGHTS HATE - HUNDREDS BECKONED TO RALLY AGAINST RACISM |url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=WORLDNEWS&req_dat=0D2A02882BC90595&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0EB536075BC73937 |work=Seattle Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Oliveria |first=DF |date=15 March 1989 |title=Foes Cheer After Butler Backs Down |url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2365090900 |work=Spokesman Review |id={{ProQuest|2365090900}} }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Associated Press |date=9 December 1988 |title=Island Residents Feel Victimized by Supremacist |url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2365340083 |work=Spokesman Review |id={{ProQuest|2365340083}} }}</ref>

The coalition's first major action occurred in 1988 at Whidbey Island, where UFAF gathered around 450 protesters to confront a small group of neo-Nazis. The demonstration was considered a success by its organizers and underscored UFAF's emphasis on unified, grassroots action and set the tone for future activities. UFAF's mobilizations included annual counter-protests at [[Whidbey Island]] and [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho]], targeting neo-Nazi gatherings and fascist organizations like the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]]. Supporters of UFAF argue these efforts played a role in reducing visible neo-Nazi activity in the region during the late 1980s and 1990s, contributing to a broader movement of grassroots resistance.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news |last=Denn |first=Rebekah |date=July 3, 1999 |title=ENUMCLAW BRACES FOR WHITE SUPREMACIST RALLY - COUNTER-DEMONSTRATORS PLAN TO BUILD 'HATE-FREE ZONE' |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Reang |first=Putsata |date=October 2, 1996 |title=SUPREMACIST GUILTY IN KLAN SCUFFLE - FEDERAL WAY MAN BROKE FREE- LANCER'S CAMERA |work=Seattle Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last1=Hopkins |first1=Jack |last2=Huang |first2=Xiangyang |date=July 5, 1999 |title=PROTESTERS DROWN OUT WHITE-PRIDE RALLY |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=August 8, 2018 |title=Looking Back: 25 Years Ago Today |work=Tacoma News Tribune}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=December 7, 2016 |editor-last=Larsen |editor-first=Jim |title=History Corner: Neo-Nazi vigil visited by protestors |work=South Whidbey Record}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=OSTROM |first=CAROL M. |date=5 December 1999 |title=LEADING WHITE SUPREMACIST VISITS - WHIDBEY APPEARANCE OF MATT HALE ALARMS HATE-WATCH GROUPS |url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=WORLDNEWS&req_dat=0D2A02882BC90595&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0ED1C882A3EC2EAC |website=Seattle Times}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite news |last=Barker |first=Kim |date=10 July 1999 |title=A WEEK LATE, BUT HATE WILL PARADE IN IDAHO |url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=WORLDNEWS&req_dat=0D2A02882BC90595&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0ED1C8158DCB6992 |work=Seattle Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Dec 12, 1988, page 11 - Kitsap Sun at Kitsap Sun |url=https://kitsapsun.newspapers.com/image/874211908 |access-date=2025-12-08 |website=Newspapers.com |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Feb 13, 1989, page 4 - Kitsap Sun at Kitsap Sun |url=https://kitsapsun.newspapers.com/image/874192078 |access-date=2025-12-08 |website=Newspapers.com |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=Dec 09, 1988, page 1 - Kitsap Sun at Kitsap Sun |url=https://kitsapsun.newspapers.com/image/874210957 |access-date=2025-12-08 |website=Newspapers.com |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Jan 13, 1989, page 11 - The News Tribune at The News Tribune |url=https://thenewstribune.newspapers.com/image/738113232 |access-date=2025-12-08 |website=Newspapers.com |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Ulrich |first=Roberta |date=12 December 1988 |title=NEO-NAZIS QUIETLY LEAVE WHIDBEY ISLAND AFTER ARYAN VIGIL |url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=WORLDNEWS&req_dat=0D2A02882BC90595&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0EB0853DC8CC9C8D |work=The Oregonian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Hatch |first=Walter |date=8 December 1988 |title=WHIDBEY RESIDENTS FEAR CLASH OF VIEWS - LEFT-WING GROUPS PLAN TO PROTEST DURING NEO-NAZI MEMORIAL SERVICE |url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=WORLDNEWS&req_dat=0D2A02882BC90595&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0EB5332144DA8B87 |work=Seattle Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Mar 15, 1989, page 7 - The Spokesman-Review at The Spokesman-Review |url=https://spokesman.newspapers.com/image/572949356 |access-date=2025-12-08 |website=Newspapers.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Ideology ===
UFAF was a broad-based, multi-racial coalition comprising activists from the [[LGBTQ community|LGBTQ+ community]], African American groups, feminists, Vietnam War veterans, labor organizers, and Chicanx activists. The organization was distinctive for its militant and [[Direct action|direct-action]] tactics, favoring active confrontation over the more passive approaches endorsed by some liberal and governmental entities. UFAF's strategy of organizing mass protests was based on the belief that white supremacist threats were political and social issues, not merely criminal matters to be managed by law enforcement.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=Nazis Suck! poster, Seattle, January 25, 1992 |url=https://mohai.org/collections-and-research/search/item/2002.23/-.8.2%23.1/ |access-date=8 December 2025 |website=MOHAI}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=McClatchy News Service |date=9 April 1989 |title=Groups ally against neo-Nazi overtones of skinhead meeting |url=https://www.proquest.com/docview/2365255567 |work=Spokesman Review |id={{ProQuest|2365255567}} }}</ref>

UFAF's stance drew criticism from law enforcement, liberal groups, and mainstream media, who advocated for litigation and non-confrontational strategies. However, UFAF argued that history had demonstrated the dangers of allowing fascist movements to grow unchecked, referencing the rise of Nazism in Germany as a cautionary example. The coalition maintained that a strong, united, working-class response was essential to counteract the far-right's divisive ideologies.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite news |last=Angelos |first=Constantine |date=12 December 1992 |title=RICE ON HOT SEAT OVER CAPITOL HILL RIOT - GROUPS SPARE NO WORDS IN LAMBASTING POLICE |url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=WORLDNEWS&req_dat=0D2A02882BC90595&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0EB535472F1C6BDA |work=Seattle Times}}</ref>

UFAF's organizing efforts were closely linked with [[Radical Women]] and the [[Freedom Socialist Party]]. The coalition highlighted the importance of building alliances across different communities—LGBTQ+, racial minorities, labor unions, feminists—to resist hate and extremism. The coalition also emphasized that confronting fascism is a collective responsibility that transcends individual movements or identities.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Yolanda Alaniz Papers |url=https://www.txarchives.org/utlac/finding_aids/00123.xml |access-date=8 December 2025 |website=Texas Archival Resources Online}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=KUEBELBECK |first=AMY |date=4 August 1990 |title=GROUPS OF GAYS PROTEST PICNIC |url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/user/login?destination=document-view%3Fp%3DWORLDNEWS%26docref%3Dnews/0EB5341AC8858585%26f%3Dbasic |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=2025-12-08 |website=Seattle Times}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Platypus Berkeley |title=Antifascism in the Age of Trump: Panel Discussion @ Berkeley City College |date=2017-10-17 |url=http://archive.org/details/berkeley-antifascism-panel |access-date=2025-12-08}}</ref><ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Dec 09, 1988, page 8 - The Spokesman-Review at The Spokesman-Review |url=https://spokesman.newspapers.com/image/572902386 |access-date=2025-12-08 |website=Newspapers.com |language=en-US}}</ref>
